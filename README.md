# Hello, I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹

I use GitHub primarily as a place to **publish finished projects** rather than for day-to-day version control.  
I do most of my coding locally, and I push here when a project reaches its final, presentable state.

## Featured Projects
- **ML-for-Formula-1** - Ongoing Project (more to come)!
- **ML-for-Big-Pharma-Stock** â€“ Machine learning models predicting stock performance at large pharmaceutical companies.
- **IRobot-Create3-Navigation** â€“ Navigation algorithms for a maze-solving robot.

**Note:** My commit activity graph is sparse because I work locally before publishing final versions here.

Feel free to contact my email at dcurran6@gatech.edu if you have any questions!
